                    <p>The Destination: Deep Space season was the fifth year for the Clairemonster Robotics team, and the first year that the team had to compete without its founding members. The team still went strong, however, and competed at the Del Mar regional as well as the Las Vegas regional. Though we didn't place as high as we may have liked, we still learned a lot about how to build our robots in the future!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Our team met every day after school and on Saturdays to brainstorm, design, and build out our robot. Just after competing at the Del Mar Regional, we realized that our design was just not working. So we took an angele grinder and chopped off the arm we created and made a box out of acryllic pannels. On the positive side, though, our pneumatic hatch-grabbing system still worked!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Unfortunately, our team decreased in size this year, only gaining three new freshmen and losing many seniors. However, our team still held strong and was still competitive in compeitions. In the future years, though, we plan to continue growing as a team!</p>

In this season we visited two competitions for the first time ever- one at Del Mar regionals, and another in Lancaster.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Every day after school, our team would get together in the old woodshop and video production room to make magic out of pool noodles and screwdrivers, and over the course of four weeks our team, consisting of  25 members were able to create a functioning robot capable of lifting power cubes up to twice the height of the robot, and maneuvering these cubes strategically around the field to accrue points.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Our team experienced a ton of growth this year, with many new members, a second competition, and the beginnings of this wonderful website you’re reading now. We can only imagine how wonderful and riveting our future as Clairemonsters will be. </p>
