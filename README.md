# Clairemonster-Website

This is the repository on the Clairemonster Robotics FRC team 5474 website.  Our website is open source.  If you would like help creating your own website (preferably a FIRST team) feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:clairemontrobotics@gmail.com">clairemontrobotics@gmail.com</a>, we are always willing to help.  We are constructing this website from scratch to help us learn about web development to teach incoming members and other teams about programming.

This website it focused primarily on creating a website to provide information about our team so that it is more appealing to sponsors, parents, and other teams looking for help.  We are constantly attempting to reach out to a greater number of people to spread our influence.
