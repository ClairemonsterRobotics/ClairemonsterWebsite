# How to Contribute

Anybody is welcome to contribute.  If you are a going to create a new page, please copy and paste the header/footer code from the basicPage.html so that all of them are consistent throughout the website.

We are building our website utilizing the Google Material Design Lite from https://getmdl.io, so feel free to implement this library when contributing to a page.

If you would like to work on new pages, we plan on adding the following pages in the future:

1. Resources for other teams -- Tutorials on how to build a website, fundraising tips, building and design tips, etc...
2. A fully functioning blog which will be updated with posts from Instagram and Facebook along with the occasional article.
3. A page where people can donate
