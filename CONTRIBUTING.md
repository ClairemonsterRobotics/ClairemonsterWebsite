# How to Contribute

Anybody is welcome to contribute.  If you are a going to create a new page, please copy and paste the header/footer code from the basicPage.html so that all of them are consistent throughout the website.

We are building our website utilizing the Google Material Design Lite from https://getmdl.io, so feel free to implement this library when contributing to a page.

If you would like to work on new pages, we plan on adding the following pages in the future:

1. Resources for other teams -- Tutorials on how to build a website, fundraising tips, building and design tips, etc...
2. A fully functioning blog which will be updated with posts from Instagram and Facebook along with the occasional article.
3. A page where people can donate/support our team

## File Structure
All files are stored under "ClairemonsterWebsite"

"src" folder contains everything except README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and LICENSE

Folder-less files in "src" are html file pages for the Website

"css" folder holds all of the CSS and the images in the "images" folder.  Place all of your CSS in the main.css

"js" folder holds all of the JavaScript

## Commenting

The goal of this repository is not only to update our website, but also to aid other FRC teams to create websites.  When you make changes, please comment on what it means so that people who are learning can understand.  No amount of commenting and description is too much.

Place all of the CSS from your page together in the main.css and comment around it to express which page it is designed for.  It should be formatted like, "<page_name>.html (Begin)" and then the same thing for the end.  Please look at the main.css document for more examples.
